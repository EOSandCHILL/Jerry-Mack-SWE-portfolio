Hello I'm Jerry and welcome to my SWE portfolio!

I am an Innovative and driven Marine Corps Veteran, with 10 years of experience in the technology industry (civilian, federal, and academically). I am in the process of finishing my bachelor’s in software development while constantly gaining new skills as a full-stack software developer at Land Intelligence, a SaaS Prop-Tech company, in Columbia, SC. My mission is to create easier access to resources for everyone, using my skills to develop scalable business, federal, and personal life-enhancing software.

Experience:

FULLSTACK SOFTWARE ENGINEER, LAND INTELLIGENCE
• I developed code, using React, that allows investors to apply for debt on our platform when they’re investing in land. This also allowed the company to gain a financial partnership and generate up to 5% in revenue from every loan application.

• I developed code, using Node.JS, that allows customers to utilize coupons for company promotions. I also developed code, using React, that made changes to the application user interface to promote products on sale. This has allowed the company to increase its user count by 15% in a month during the sale/promotion.

• I utilize web-based digital intelligence systems that allow me to improve our customer's experience by tracking and monitoring user activity. I track user sessions, page transitions, rage clicks, and checkout funnels which helps me determine how to increase the users' experience.

• I reviewed and pushed code to production, allowing land and GIS data to be more high-quality and detailed for our customers. This allows over 80% of the users to find and invest in land that fits their specific land development needs.

• I am responsible for creating product and technical documentation for 6 financial products and 2 financial projects that I’m currently managing, generating 30% of the company’s revenue.

• I utilize software tools like Atlassian’s Jira for workflow and confluence for documentation, I use HubSpot for business integrations, SharePoint for team documents, Stripe for payment integrations, FullStory for UI/UX feedback, AWS for running builds, Figma for wireframing, Docker for running and building apps, MySQL to manage company databases, Slack and Teams for communication, GIT and GitHub to manage repositories daily.
